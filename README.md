# ReactWeather

A React and Redux project based on the Udemy lessons of Stephen Grider.
This weather app allows a user to enter any city in the US and uses Axios to make
an Ajax request to fetch weather data using the Open Weather API. It returns
temperature in Kelvin, humidity in hPA, and pressure in % and also makes and API call to
Google Maps to return a map of the requested city.


## Technology:
* JavaScript (ES6)
* React and Redux
* AJAX
* Bootstrap
* Google Maps API
* Open Weather API

## How to Use the React Weather App

As additional cities are entered, the screen will update to include the original
search, as well as any new cities.
